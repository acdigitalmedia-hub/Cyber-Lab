# Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio

Hi, I’m Austin.

I’m a cybersecurity professional transitioning from the U.S. Air Force, where I spent over a decade working in technical, operational, and leadership roles. This repository is a living collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects I’ve built in my personal lab as I continue sharpening my skills and preparing for my next role.

Rather than treating this lab as a checkbox exercise, I use it to simulate realistic scenarios, test tools the way they’re actually used in the field, and document what I learn along the way (including what *doesn’t* work).

## What This Repository Is

This repo contains practical, self-directed cybersecurity projects focused on:

- Security monitoring and detection engineering  
- SIEM deployment and tuning  
- Incident response workflows  
- Identity, authentication, and Active Directory security  
- Blue-team and defensive security concepts grounded in real-world use cases  

Each project includes:
- A clear goal and environment description  
- Step-by-step implementation notes  
- Validation and screenshots  
- Lessons learned and follow-up ideas  

The intent is not to be exhaustive or academic, but to show how I think, how I troubleshoot, and how I translate theory into working systems.

## Project Index

| # | Project |
|---|--------|
| 001 | Splunk Enterprise – Installation & Basic Configuration
| 002 | Detecting and Alerting SSH Brute Force in Splunk |
| 003 | Splunk - More Data Ingestion |
| 004 | Splunk - Attacking and Detecting |
| 005 | Basic Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus |
| 006 | TBD |

Projects live under the `projects/` directory and are numbered in the order they were completed.

## Lab Environment (High Level)

My lab is built to be flexible and intentionally imperfect. It's probably closer to what you find in real environments than in polished demos.

- Virtualized environment (Linux + Windows)
- SIEM, endpoint, and identity tooling
- Mix of manual configuration and automation
- Focus on understanding *why* things work, not just making them work

Specific environment details are documented within each project.

## Why I’m Sharing This Publicly

I learn best by building and teaching. Writing these walkthroughs forces me to slow down, question assumptions, and explain decisions clearly. These are the same skills that matter in security operations and incident response roles.

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow practitioner, this repo is meant to give you a concrete sense of:
- how I approach problems  
- how I document technical work  
- how I learn and improve over time
